###Geometry: Scalars, vectors and matrices:

Geometry plays an important part of game development. We need to know where things are and how they relate to one another. Is the player on the ground? did a bullet hit its target, how does an object move? These and many more questions can only be answered with maths.

The basic components we work with are **scalars**, **vectors** and **matrices**.

A **scalar** is a single number, for example *5.6* or *2*. In C# scalars are usually saved as `floats` for numbers with decimals or `ints` if we only care about whole numbers.

A **vector** is a list of numbers. The `Vector2` class in monogame for example is a list of two floats. While Vectors can be used for many things, we will mostly use them for locations and directions.

A **Matrix** is a table of data. A 3x3 matrix 

$\overset{ \rightarrow }{v}$

The length of a vector is often written as $\left|\left| \overset{ \rightarrow }{v} \right| \right|$ and can be calculated using the Pythagorian theorem, $lemgth =. \sqrt(x^2 + y^2)$.
